# Security Policy

## Supported Versions

Security updates will typically only be applied to the latest release unless
you have a support contract with Graphile and have arranged otherwise.

## Reporting a Vulnerability

If you have a support contract, please raise a ticket at the help desk and we
will get back to you as fast as we can.

Otherwise, please let Benjie know privately of any security vulnerabilities
by emailing benjie#graphile_org. Benjie will get back to you as soon as he
can; typically within 2 working days, and will discuss the future steps.

Graphile is a community-funded open-source project so we're sorry to say that
we cannot afford bug bounties at this time. We can, however, send you some
PostGraphile stickers :heart: :elephant:
